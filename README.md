<p> This project originated from a Javascript Mastery course on YouTube, serving as the ideal foundation for practicing React. My biggest challenge and source of pride was the solo implementation of TypeScript, which transformed the website into a robust and fully functional project.

Throughout the development process, I explored several cutting-edge technologies, including:

Three.js and GSAP to create a dynamic visual experience and sophisticated animations.

Integration with various APIs, specifically EmailJS, for contact functionality.

The result is a portfolio that demonstrates not only my skills in React but also my ability to tackle and overcome complex technical challenges.
